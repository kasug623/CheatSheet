# Network
## Ubuntu Server 20.04 / 22.04.4 LTS
- `netplan`
    ```zsh
    $ sudo vi /etc/netplan/99_config.yaml
    ```
    deprecated version
    ```yaml
    network:
        ethernets:
            ens18:
                dhcp4: false

                        - 8.8.4.4

    new version
    ```yaml

            nameservers:
                addresses:
                    - 8.8.8.8

    ```
    ```zsh
    $ sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/99_config.yaml
    $ sudo netplan apply
    $ ip a
    ```
- `nmcli`  
    When setting the IP address with the configuration method set to static (manual),
    the connection name is usually 'Wired Connection 1'.  
    Autocomplete should work.
    ```
    $ nmcli c modify <connection name> ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses x.x.x.x/prefix
    ```
    When setting only the IP address:  
    ```
    $ nmcli c modify <connection name> ipv4.addresses x.x.x.x/prefix
    ```
    When configuring to use DHCP:  
    ```
    $ nmcli c modify <connection name> ipv4.method auto
    ```

# Server
## Change of resolution
Itâ€™s difficult.  
Adjusting on another terminal via SSH is preferable.  
You can change it with GRUB as a fallback, but it only supports modifications allowed by the OS, so it may not suit modern large displays.  

## Keyboard language settings
I couldn't change it using `localectl` or `setxkbmap`.  
It might be because the OS simply doesn't have the Japanese configuration files.  
It seems better to give up and access via SSH from another terminal.
