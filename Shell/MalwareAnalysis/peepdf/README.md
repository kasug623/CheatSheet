# overview
`peepdf` is a python-based tool that can be used to analyze and manipulate PDF files in a security context. It can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities in PDF files, such as malware or malicious JavaScript code.

- Analyze PDF file  
Once you have launched `peepdf`, you can use various commands to analyze the PDF file. For example, you can use the info command to view information about the PDF file, such as its version, the number of objects, the encryption status, etc.

- Identify vulnerabilities  
You can use `peepdf` to identify potential vulnerabilities in PDF files, such as malware or malicious JavaScript code. For example, you can use the js command to view any JavaScript code contained in the PDF file, and the streams command to view the contents of any streams in the file.

- Modify PDF file  
You can also use peepdf to modify the contents of a PDF file. For example, you can use the js command to add or remove JavaScript code from the file, and the streams command to add or modify the contents of streams in the file.

Note: Keep in mind that using peepdf or any other tool to modify a PDF file can potentially cause the file to become corrupted or introduce security vulnerabilities, so be cautious when using these tools and always make backups of your files.
