# overview
`QPDF` is a command-line tool that is commonly used in the cyber security field for manipulating PDF files. It can be used for tasks such as encrypting and decrypting PDF files, adding and removing password protection, and merging or splitting PDF files. Here's how you can use some of the most common features of qpdf:

# usage
## 1. Encrypting a PDF file  
```
qpdf --encrypt foo_password 128 -- file.pdf encrypted_file.pdf
```
In this command, "foo_password" is the password used to encrypt the file, and "128" is the encryption strength in bits.

## 2. Decrypting a PDF file:
```
$ qpdf --decrypt --password=foo_password encrypted_file.pdf decrypted_file.pdf
```

## 3. Merging PDF files:
```
$ qpdf --empty --pages file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf -- file_merged.pdf
```

## 4. Splitting a PDF file:
```
$ qpdf --split=2 --file.pdf split_file
```
In this command, "2" is the number of pages in each split file.
